## âž• Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions in Python

Arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical operations in Python. These include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

### ðŸ§® Common Arithmetic Operators:

| Operator | Description       | Example       | Result |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition           | `5 + 3`       | `8`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `10 - 4`      | `6`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `6 * 7`       | `42`   |
| `/`      | Division           | `20 / 4`      | `5.0`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division     | `20 // 3`     | `6`    |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder)| `10 % 3`      | `1`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation     | `2 ** 3`      | `8`    |

## Code to multiply and add numbers

a = 5
b = 3
c = 2

result = (a * b) + c

print("The result of (a * b) + c is:", result)

## Code to convert minutes to hours

a = input("Enter minutes that needs to be converted to hours")

b = a/60

print(b)

### Objectives

- Understand basic arithmetic operations in Python  
- Explore commonly used Data Science tools and libraries  
- Learn how to create and format markdown and code cells in Jupyter Notebook  
- Practice writing and executing Python code  
- Gain familiarity with asynchronous programming and HTTP requests using `aiohttp`
